E.g.\n\n/target Ragnaros\n - Ragnaros will be the \nfinal target\n.\n\n\nchecked target\n\n\nThe unit against which all conditions will be checked. E.g.\n\n/target [harm @mouseover] Ragnaros\n - Your current mouseover target will be\nthe \nchecked target\n while \nRagnaros\n is still the \nfinal target\n.\n\n\n\n\nAs stated before, instead of checking the final target, all conditions will\nbe validated against the checked target. This means that your checked target\nmay or may not be the same as your final target. This allows you to create more\nspecialized macros and, on top of that, is more intuitive to use.\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n/target [harm @mouseover] Ragnaros; Dotalock\n\n\n\n\nThis will target Ragnaros, if your mouseover target is hostile to yourself. If\nit isn't the player Dotalock will be targeted instead.\n\n\nAdditionally, assume you want to target your mouseover target depending on\nwhether or not some pre-conditions are met. In Vanilla WoW, there is no way to\ndo something like that. With this AddOn, however, we can do things like this:\n\n\n/target [harm @target] @targettarget\n\n\n\n\nWhen you use this macro, you will target your target's target, if your current\ntarget is considered hostile towards you.\n\n\nKnown issues\n\n\nAssume you're assaulting a capital like Orgrimmar or Stormwind and you have a\nmacro like the following:\n\n\n/target [harm @mouseover] @mouseover\n\n\n\n\nNow you're trying to use this macro to select one of the city's guards that is\na fair bit away from you. Because of the way the Vanilla client implements\ntargeting by names, you're not guaranteed to target your mouseover target. This\nwill always happen when another unit with the same name is closer to you than\nthe desired unit.
